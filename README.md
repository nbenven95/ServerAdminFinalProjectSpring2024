# Final project for SUNY Adirondack CIS 232 - Server Administration
This project tasked us with deploying a simple web application or website using Microsoft Azure.
I opted to implement my application using Node.js for simplicity and ease of management.

For now, I am focusing more on the cloud deployment aspect and less on the functionality of the
application, but I plan to add more in the future when time permits.
